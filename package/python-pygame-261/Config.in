      This package provides the Pygame Python library (version 2.6.1) built
      against SDL2 and related graphics dependencies. Pygame enables
      development of multimedia applications and games in Python and
      requires SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, libpng, libjpeg and freetype
      for full functionality. Selecting this option will build
      and install the pygame module for Python, linked against the
      Raspberry Pi 5 graphics stack.
